# Marketplace Concepts: Users, Companies and Apps [](id=marketplace-concepts-users-companies-and-apps)

Anyone can browse the apps available on Liferay Marketplace at
[http://liferay.com/marketplace](http://liferay.com/marketplace) but a
`liferay.com` user account is required for purchasing and downloading apps,
whether from the Marketplace website or from an existing Liferay installation.
Many official Liferay apps, as well as some third party apps, are available free
of charge. Other apps require you to pay a fee in order to access them. When you
purchase an app, you can do so on your own behalf or on behalf of a company.
Apps purchased on your own behalf are associated with your personal
`liferay.com` user account. Apps purchased on behalf of a company are associated
with the company's account and can be accessed by any users who belong to the
company. Once you've purchased an app, you're free to download and install any
available version of the app whenever you like. We'll explain how to set up a
company account, manage company apps and join companies after we discuss how to
access Liferay Marketplace.
