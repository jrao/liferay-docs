# Summary [](id=summary-13)

In this chapter, we began to examine Liferay's control panel. Site memberships
and teams aren't the only way for portal administrators to group and manage
users: organizations can be used to arrange users into hierarchical structures
and user groups are a flexible way to collect groups of users that transcend
organizational hierarchies. You can create roles to define permissions and scope
them for the entire portal or for a particular site or organization. User groups
can be assigned to roles; in this case, each member of the user group is
assigned to the role. 

We also looked at how to configure password policies for users. Next, we looked
at the different authentication options provided by Liferay. You can configure
Liferay so that users can authenticate via LDAP, CAS, Facebook, NTLM, OpenID,
OpenSSO, or SiteMinder. Finally, we examined some general configuration options
for the portal users. We'll continue our coverage of Liferay's control panel in
the next chapter.
