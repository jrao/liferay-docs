# Management [](id=management)

You know how all these retailers advertise themselves as a "one stop shop" for
anything you want? The idea is they have so much stuff that chances are whatever
you're looking for is there. Liferay's control panel is something like this. If
you want to create users, sites, organizations, configure permissions and
plugins and pretty much anything else, you'll do it with the control panel. The
nice thing about the control panel is it makes all this very easy to do. This
chapter takes all the concepts you learned about Liferay in chapter 1 (sites,
organizations, and more) and makes them concrete. Here, you'll learn how to
create and manage every aspect of Liferay's configuration. 

This chapter explains how to use the control panel to manage the following:

- Users
- Organizations
- User Groups
- Roles
- Password Policies
- Authentication Policies
- Global User Settings

Let's begin our examination of Liferay's control panel by looking at how to
manage users in Liferay Portal.
