# The Portal Section of the Control Panel [](id=the-portal-section-of-the-control-panel)

The Portal section of the control panel is used for most administrative tasks.
You'll find there an interface for the creation and maintenance of the following
portal entities: users, organizations, user groups, sites, teams, site
templates, page templates, and roles. Additionally, you can configure many
settings, including the following: password policies, portal settings, custom
fields, monitoring, and plugins configuration.

![Figure 15.1: The Portal Section of the control panel allows portal administrators to manage users, organizations, sites, teams, site templates, page templates, and roles, as well as various portal settings.](../../images/portal-section-control-panel.png)

Since we explained how to manage sites, teams, site templates, and page
templates in chapters 2 and 3, we won't discuss them in detail here. In this
chapter, we'll focus on using the control panel for user management. We'll
finish our coverage of the control panel in the next chapter, discussing portal
and server administration.

As a portal administrator, you'll use the Portal section of the control panel to
create your portal structure, implement security, and administer your users.
Configurable portal settings include mail host names, email notifications and
authentication options including single sign-on and LDAP integration. Note that
only users with the administrator role, which is a portal scoped role, have
permission to view this section of the control panel. You can, of course, grant
permissions to one or more sections to custom roles.
