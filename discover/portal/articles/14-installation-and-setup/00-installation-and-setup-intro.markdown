# Installation and Setup [](id=installation-and-setup)

Liferay Portal is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
regard to application server environments. You can install Liferay Portal on
everything from a shared Tomcat installation to a multi-node cluster running a
commercial application server and on everything in between. In fact, Liferay is
used successfully in all of these scenarios every day.

You'll find that because Liferay is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is easy to install as well. If you already have an application
server, you can use the tools for deployment that came with your application
server. If you don't have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are very easy to install
and with a small amount of configuration can be made into production-ready
systems.
