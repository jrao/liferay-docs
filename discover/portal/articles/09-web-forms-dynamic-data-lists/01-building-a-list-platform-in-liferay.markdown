# Building a List Platform in Liferay [](id=building-a-list-platform-in-liferay)

To expand and extend the social capabilities of our site, we want to build a
new, radical platform on Liferay: custom-built lists that users can share and
collaborate on with their friends (or enemies, depending on their Social
Relation type). Marketing has come up with a great name for our new service:
`list.it`. Our beautiful `list.it` dashboard will give users the power to
generate their own lists, see the lists of their friends and tally the results
of certain types of lists (surveys, anyone?). Liferay makes this as simple as
throwing some Dynamic Data List Display and Form portlets on a user's private
and public user pages.
