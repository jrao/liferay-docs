# Web Content Management [](id=web-content-management)

Web Content Management is a system which allows non-technical users to publish
content to the web without having advanced knowledge of web technology or
programming of any sort. Liferay WCM empowers you to publish your content with a
simple point and click interface and it helps you to keep your site fresh.
You'll find yourself easily creating, editing and publishing content within just
a few minutes of being exposed to its features. But Liferay WCM doesn't
sacrifice power for simplicity. If need be, you can use your developer skills to
create complex presentation layer templates that make your content "pop" with
dynamic elements. Once these templates have been deployed into the portal, your
non-technical users can manage content using these templates as easily as they
would manage static content. All of this makes Liferay WCM an appropriate choice
for sites with only a few pages or sites with gigabytes of content. 

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics: 

- Features of Liferay WCM
- Creating sites and managing pages
- Authoring content
- Publishing content
- Workflow
- Site memberships and permissions

As you'll see, Liferay's WCM is a full-featured solution for managing your web
site. We'll start with an overview of what it has to offer and then we'll dive
down into its features. Note that web content is just one kind of asset on
Liferay. Other types of content (blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts,
etc.) are also considered assets. Liferay provides a general framework for
handling assets that includes tags, categories, comments, ratings, and more.
Please see chapter 5 for more information on Liferay's asset framework.
