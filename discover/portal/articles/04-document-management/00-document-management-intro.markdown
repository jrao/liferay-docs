# Document Management [](id=document-management)

Liferay's Documents and Media library provides a mechanism for storing files
online using the same type of structure that you use to store files locally. You
can use it to store files of any kind; it serves as a virtual shared drive. The
Documents and Media portlet takes its name from the fact that it represents a
redesign of two portlets from previous versions: the Document Library and the
Image Gallery. First, the Documents and Media library serves as a repository
for all types of files; there's no need to store image files in a separate
Image Gallery anymore. Second, the Media Gallery portlet introduced in Liferay
6.1 does not serve as a repository but just displays selected content from the
Documents and Media library. It can display image, audio and video files. Other
new features include customizable document types and metadata sets, automatic
document preview generation, and support for mounting multiple external
repositories. The new document types and metadata sets are an addition to, not
a replacement for, the portal's system of tags and categories. Let's start
exploring how to use the Documents and Media portlet.
