# Personalization and Customization [](id=personalization-and-customization)

In this chapter, we discuss several ways Liferay users can customize pages,
applications, and the way they use your portal. We'll cover the following
topics:

- Personal Sites
- Customizable Pages and Applications
- Using a Rules Engine

Personal sites allow each portal user to manage and customize a set of public
and/or private pages and any associated content or applications. Public pages
provide a means of making content publicly available while private pages provide
a means of hiding information from other users. Liferay 6.1 introduced
customizable pages and applications. Administrators can designate certain pages
or applications as "customizable," which allows each user to make and save their
own customizations. Liferay Enterprise Edition provides a rules engine which
allows administrators to create custom portal rules and simplify complex blocks
of code containing lots of `if-else` statements. Let's start by discussing
personal sites.
