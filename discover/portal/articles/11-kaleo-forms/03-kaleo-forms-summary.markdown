# Summary [](id=summary-9)

As you can see, Liferay Portal and the Kaleo Workflow engine combine to create a
very robust environment for web content management. The Kaleo Forms portlet
allows you to manage all available workflows in the portal. You can create your
portal's workflows by using the Kaleo Designer's unique drag and drop interface.
Simple workflows can be managed using the default configuration and GUI tools,
while more complex workflows can be created to meet the workflow management
needs of almost any portal. Through this chapter and the previous one, we've
taken a look at the various elements of a workflow and shown how to use those
elements to create your own custom workflows. We've also seen how to properly
use the various elements of a workflow like Assignments and Notifications, as
well as newer and more advanced features like Parallel Workflows, Timers, and
Custom Scripts.

It's not enough to understand each individual step of the workflow process; one
of the keys to using Kaleo workflow is to understand how each step interacts
with the other elements. If you understand these relationships, you can figure
out which features will to work best for your organization. We hope you'll use
the information we've covered on workflows to craft suitable processes for your
portal.
