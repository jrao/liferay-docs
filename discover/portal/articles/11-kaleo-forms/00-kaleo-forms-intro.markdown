# Kaleo Forms: Defining Business Processes [](id=kaleo-forms-defining-business-processes)

![EE Only Feature](../../images/ee-feature-web.png)

In the last chapter, we looked at the elements that comprise a workflow
definition and discussed how to create a workflow definition. In this chapter,
we introduce the Kaleo Workflow Designer for Liferay EE which allows you to
create workflow definitions using an intuitive UI. Using the workflow designer
saves you the time and trouble of having to deal directly with the XML.

Developers who are used to working with XML are generally able to create
workflow definitions. Other users may not be so comfortable with it. In fact,
even skilled developers can make mistakes that break a definition and require
time to troubleshoot. To help streamline the creation of workflow definitions
and empower more users to create custom workflows, Liferay provides the Kaleo
Workflow Designer in Liferay 6.1 EE.

There are two pieces to the workflow designer: *Kaleo Forms* and *Kaleo
Designer*. Kaleo Forms is an extension of the Dynamic Data Lists feature
(covered in chapter 9). This enables you to create web forms and basic
applications, then apply a workflow to govern the processing of those forms.
Kaleo Designer is a drag and drop interface for creating new workflow
definitions. It can be used in conjunction with Kaleo Forms or standalone to
create workflow definitions without having to write XML.

Let's look at Kaleo Forms first.
