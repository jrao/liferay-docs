# Summary [](id=summary-14)

In this chapter, we finished our overview of Liferay's control panel that we
began in chapter 15. We saw how to configure mail host names, email
notifications, identification, and portal display settings. We showed how you
add custom fields to various portal entities such as users, pages, documents,
wiki articles, message board posts, and more. 

Next, we saw how to view and configure overall server settings. We saw how to
view the memory currently being used by the server, as well as how to initiate
garbage collection, a thread dump, search engine re-indexing and the clearing of
various caches. We learned how to debug parts of the portal by changing log
levels and by viewing the various properties defined in the portal.

Finally, we learned how to properly notify users that the portal is about to
shut down and how to set up external services like OpenOffice integration. We
looked at how to create multiple portal instances on a single installation of
Liferay and we showed how to view currently installed plugins.

We hope this information helps you become an effective Liferay Portal
Administrator.
