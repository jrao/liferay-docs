# Plugins Configuration [](id=plugins-configuration)

The Plugins Configuration page contains tabs for three types of plugins:
portlets, themes and layouts. You can use these tabs to view which roles can add
plugins to pages or you can make the plugins active or inactive.

Note that this is for basic configuration: if you want to view the existing
permission configuration for a given portlet and/or modify that configuration
for existing roles, this is where you can do that. If you need to add
permissions to new roles for a given portlet, use the Roles section of the
control panel and the *Actions &rarr; Define Permissions* button. Next, let's
look at how to apply server configurations.
