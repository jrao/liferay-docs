# Plugins Installation [](id=plugins-installation)

The *Plugins Installation* page of the control panel shows all of the plugins
currently installed. These are divided into tabs for portlets, themes, layout
templates, hook plugins and web plugins. If you want to install a new plugin,
click the *Install More Portlets* button. You will then be brought to the Plugin
Installer, where you can browse Liferay's repository of portlets or install your
own plugins. We covered the plugins installer and explained how to install
plugins manually in chapter 13.
