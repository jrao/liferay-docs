In this chapter, we examined two Liferay utility applications: the Software
Catalog and the Knowledge Base. The Software Catalog allows you to define a set
of software items to make available to visitors to your portal. Remember that
the Software Catalog will be replaced by Liferay Marketplace and will soon be
deprecated. The Knowledge Base application is an EE-only application that
allows you to create articles and organize them into full books or guides that
be published on your portal. Liferay's Weather portlet displays basic
weather-related information for multiple configurable locations. Next, let's
take a tour of the Liferay Marketplace and learn how to manage Liferay plugins.
