# Liferay Utility Applications [](id=liferay-utility-applications)

In this chapter we'll look at some Liferay utility applications that might be
useful for you. The Software Catalog is currently packaged with Liferay but will
soon be replaced by Liferay Marketplace. Please see chapter 13 for information
about Liferay Marketplace and managing Liferay plugins. The Knowledge Base
application is an EE-only plugin. In this chapter we'll discuss several of these
applications:

- Bookmarks
- Weather
- Software catalog
- Shopping
- Knowledge Base

Liferay's Bookmarks application is a simple way for users to keep track of URLs
in the portal that can also be used by an administrator to publish relevant
links to groups of users. The Software Catalog allows you to define a set of
software items to display to visitors. The Knowledge Base application allows you
to create articles and organize them into full books or guides that be published
on your portal.
