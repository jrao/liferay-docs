# Using Alloy UI in your Application [](id=using-alloy-ui-in-your-application)

When it comes to your application's UI components, AlloyUI is hands down the 
best choice. AlloyUI provides an easy to use framework with a uniform API, 
allowing you to keep a consistent look and feel throughout your application.

If you've followed the learning paths that preceded, you learned how to get 
your application up and running, provided a database to hold all of your data, 
implemented security using Liferay's permission system, and implemented actions 
in your application. In this learning path, you'll learn how to use AlloyUI to 
implement form validation and traverse the DOM. Using the application you've
already been working on, you can continue its development by following this
learning path.
