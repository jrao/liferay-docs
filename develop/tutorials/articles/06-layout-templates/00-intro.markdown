# Creating Liferay Layout Templates [](id=creating-liferay-layout-templates)

By now, you've likely added portlets to a page by dragging them from the *Add*
menu and dropping them into place. Are there times, though, when you find
yourself limited by Liferay's page layout options? Maybe your Feng Shui
(pronounced *fung SHWAY*) senses are picking up on some negative energy? Or
perhaps you find yourself adding the same portlets over and over again onto the
same types of pages? Don't despair! Break the monotony by creating your own
custom layout templates. Layout template plugins let you design layouts that
flow nicely, embed commonly used portlets, and apply CSS, Velocity, and HTML to
make your pages visually pop. 

In this chapter, you'll learn everything you need to know about layout
templates:

- Creating a layout template project 
- Anatomy of a layout template project 
- Designing a layout template 
- Embedding portlets in a layout template 
- Available variables 

Let's create a custom layout template!
