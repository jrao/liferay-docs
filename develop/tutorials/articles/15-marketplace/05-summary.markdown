# Summary [](id=summary-12)

In this chapter we introduced concepts and instructions for developers to make
their apps available on the Liferay Marketplace. We looked at how to create,
publish, maintain, and track apps. You do this through
[liferay.com](http://liferay.com), using your own personal credentials and its
features for Marketplace. Next, we covered the requirements for publishing apps,
which did not differ significantly from requirements for general Liferay
development. We then showed how you can publish a sample app on the Marketplace
and how you can modify it as the app evolves. Finally, we looked at how to track
the adoption of apps using view, download, and install metrics. We hope this
information helps you understand how to develop apps for Liferay!

Next, we'll take a look at some helpful plugin developer references. So get
ready to bookmark plenty of links!
