# File Storage Framework [](id=file-storage-framework)

The File Storage Framework lets you store files using the back end of the
Document Library. If you use this framework you won't have to worry about
clustering or backups, since they'll already be taken care of for the Document
Library itself. To see examples of this framework in action, check out the
source code for the built in *wiki* and *message boards* portlets of Liferay;
the File Storage Framework stores their attached files in pages and posts,
respectively.
