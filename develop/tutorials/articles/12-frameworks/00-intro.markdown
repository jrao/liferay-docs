# Liferay Frameworks [](id=liferay-frameworks)

Picture a hot, summer day. You're on vacation, and you're just coming back from
the beach after a day of frolicking on the sand and in the water. After all that
activity, you're hungry. Time to grill up some burgers and dogs. 

To grill hamburgers and hot dogs, you have to have a proper procedure and
apparatus for accomplishing the task. The *procedure* would be called an
algorithm in computer science terms. The *apparatus* is the framework. 

You first need a grill. That grill should be equipped with a heating mechanism;
in the case of most grills, that's either charcoal or propane gas. Obviously,
it also has a metal frame, or grill, placed near the heat. You also need tools,
such as a spatula, a plate to hold the meat, and if you're making chicken in
addition to those burgers, a brush and some barbecue sauce. 

All of these together form a *framework* for making grilled food on a hot
summer day. All the tools you need are at your disposal; you just need to pick
them up and get grilling! If the framework is already in place, it's obviously
a lot easier (and more timely) to cook food than it would be if the framework
weren't there. Just ask the cave men. 

Liferay contains several frameworks that give you all the tools you need to
perform various common tasks, such has handling permissions, letting users
enter comments, categories, and tags, and other common tasks that Liferay
doesn't make you have to write yourself. 

Here's what we've got in store for you: 

- Security and Permissions 
- Asset Framework 
- File Storage Framework 
- Other Frameworks 

Let's start by getting acquainted with a framework that nobody relishes having
to write themselves: security.
