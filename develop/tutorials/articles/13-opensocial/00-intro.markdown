# Creating and Integrating with OpenSocial Gadgets [](id=creating-and-integrating-with-opensocial-gadgets)

OpenSocial is a public specification for creating web applications using
standard technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was originally
developed by Google, Myspace and others to standardize common social networking
API's but has evolved into a general platform for building web applications.
Whereas "standard" applications work with data on a per-user basis, "social"
applications share data within well defined networks, facilitating communication
of information between groups of users. OpenSocial applications, called
*gadgets*, are similar to portlets because they can be added to your portal's
pages and used for all kinds of tasks. Gadgets are characterized as being
simple, widely available, and easy to deploy.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:

- OpenSocial gadget basics.
- Using PubSub to allow gadgets to communicate with each other and with
  portlets.
- Liferay's gadget editing environment.

Let's first look at the structure of an OpenSocial gadget and consider the
