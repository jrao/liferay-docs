# Summary [](id=summary-5)

Ext plugins are a powerful way to extend Liferay. There are no limits to what
you can use them to customize, so use them carefully. Before using an Ext
plugin, see if you can implement all or part of the desired functionality
through a different plugin type: portlets, hooks, and web plugins offer you a
lot of extension capabilities themselves, without introducing the complexity
that's inherent with Ext plugins. If you need to use an Ext plugin, make it as
small as possible and follow the instructions in this guide carefully to avoid
issues.

Next we'll learn how to develop Liferay using the Maven build framework.
