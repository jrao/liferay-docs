# Summary [](id=summary-1)

You've covered a lot of ground in this chapter. You learned how to map out
your data model as entities to use in services. You used Service Builder and
Liferay IDE's powerful editing modes to create services, relate service
entities, and generate your implementation stubs. You implemented business
logic and re-ran Service Builder to generate the corresponding interfaces. You
found out that integrating your own SQL queries in your services was easy and
that model hints enable you to specify service entity data limitations and to
make entity display customizations. You also briefly implemented remote services
but you merely scratched the surface of this topic. 

What better way to keep things rolling than turn our attention to your portal's
overall look and feel using Liferay Themes! We'll develop Themes next.
