# Summary [](id=summary-11)

In this chapter, we've discussed the reasons for plugin security management, how
the Plugin Security Manager checks each plugin against its portal access control
list (PACL), and how to specify PACL properties for the plugins you create and
deploy. We also explained Liferay's support of the Java
Security Policy, in case you need to specify rules above and beyond what PACL
properties support. 

Now you have a better understanding of how plugin security works, and can use
Liferay Portal's Plugin Security Manager effectively to specify exactly what
services your plugin needs in order to function. Anyone running Liferay Portal
with Security Manager turned on will know you're a "law abiding" citizen,
because you've specified what services your applications need to access in order
to function.

Next, we'll show you what it takes to develop apps for publishing to
*Liferay Marketplace*.
