# Using Message Bus [](id=using-message-bus)

The *Message Bus* is a service level API used to exchange messages within
Liferay. The Message Bus is a mechanism for sending message payloads to
different components in Liferay, providing loose coupling between message
producers and consumers to prevent class loading issues. It's located in
the global class loader, making it accessible to every deployed web application.
Remote messaging isn't supported, but messages are sent across a cluster
when ClusterLink is enabled. 

Message Bus has several common uses, including sending search index write
events, sending subscription emails, handling messages at scheduler endpoints,
and running asynchronous processes. 

You can leverage Message Bus to send messages between and within your plugins. 

As we show you Message Bus we'll talk about things like *synchronous* and
*asynchronous* messaging , *serial* vs. *in-parallel* message dispatching, and
Java and JSON style messages formats. 

Before we get into those topics, let's first try to understand Message Bus
System's architecture. 

<!--Is a subtopic list okay? -->

<!-- No; I changed it to a paragraph-based list. -Rich -->

<!--It looks like Rich changed the "common uses" list instead of the
"subtopics" list, so I left his change and also changed the subtopics list into
a paragraph. Russ--> 

## The Message Bus System [](id=the-message-bus-system)

The Message Bus system contains the following components: 

- **Message Bus**: Manages transfer of messages from message *senders* to message
  *listeners*. 
- **Destinations**: Addresses or endpoints to which *listeners* register to
  receive messages. 
- **Listeners**: Consume messages received at destinations. They receive all
  messages sent to their registered destinations.
- **Senders**: Invoke the Message Bus to send messages to destinations. 

Your services can send messages to one or more destinations, and can listen
to one or more destinations. The figure below depicts this. An individual
service can be both a message sender and a message listener. For example, in the
figure below both *Plugin 2 - Service 3* and *Plugin 5 - Service 7* send and
listen for messages. 

![Figure 11.4: Example, Message Bus system](../../images/msg-bus-system.png)

The Message Bus supports *synchronous* and *asynchronous* messaging: 

- **Synchronous messaging**: After it sends a message, the sender blocks waiting
  for a response from a recipient. 
- **Asynchronous messaging**: After it sends a message, the sender is free to
  continue processing. The sender can be configured to receive a call-back or
  can simply send and forget. We'll show you how to implement both synchronous
  and asynchronous messaging in this section. 
    - **Call-back**: The sender can include a call-back destination key as the
      response destination for the message. The recipient (listener) can then
      send a response message back to the sender via this response destination. 
    - **Send-and-Forget**: The sender includes no call-back information in the
      message sent and continues with processing.

Configuration of Message Bus is done using the following files:

- `WEB-INF/src/META-INF/messaging-spring.xml`: Specifies your destinations,
  listeners, and their mappings to each other. 
- `WEB-INF/web.xml`: Holds a listing of deployment descriptors for your plugin.
  Make sure you add `messaging-spring.xml` to your list of Spring configurations
  in this file.

+$$$

**Note:** The internal file `META-INF/messaging-core-spring.xml` of
`portal-impl.jar` specifies the default Message Bus class, default asynchronous
message sender class, and default synchronous message sender class for Liferay. 

$$$

You can control your *Message Types* by using either the `Message` or
`JSONObject` class. Liferay core services are typically serialized and
deserialized in JSON. In our examples we'll demonstrate both types of message
classes. 

So far we've introduced the Message Bus System, including message types,
destinations, senders, listeners, and approaches to sending messages. Next we'll
show you how easy it is to create your destinations, register listeners, and
send your messages. To demonstrate, we'll implement a business use case.

## Example Use Case--Procurement process [](id=example-use-case-procurement-process)

Our use case will consider Jungle Gyms R-Us and its distribution of playground
equipment, buying the equipment from manufacturers and selling the equipment to
retailers. We'll focus on the company's process for procuring new jungle gym
equipment. Let's lay out this process now.

Jungle Gyms R-Us employs the following departments in their procurement process: 

- *Procurement Department*: Scouts out the latest equipment deals of
  manufacturers.
- *Finance Department*: Determines whether the equipment can be purchased based
  on budget.
- *Legal Department*: Determines whether the equipment's safety ratings are
  acceptable.
- *Warehouse Department*: Recieves the equipment, stores it, and prepares it for
  shipping.
- *Sales Department*: Builds relationships with prospective customers to sell
  them products.

The departments currently use email to exchange comments about new equipment
purchases, but someone always seems to be left out of the loop. One time, Sales
was gung-ho about getting their hands on the latest and greatest spring rider
animals from Boingo-Boingo Industries, but they didn't consider the failing
safety reviews discovered by the Legal department, because the Legal department
forgot to copy the Sales department in their email to Procurement.  Tempers flew,
feelings were hurt, and everybody avoided hanging out in the company breakroom
for the next couple of weeks. 

<!-- Now that I see that this example is not a functional or even a potential
real-world example, I think we need to scrap the whole thing and come up with
another example, one that is integrated into an actual application. We could
conceivablly salvage it by making it into a purchase request application:
Departments have to enter purchase requests, and the message bus automatically
emails certain departments when a purchase request is entered. -Rich -->

Jungle Gyms R-Us could use Liferay's [Workflow with
Kaleo](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-1/workflow-with-kaleo)
to resolve the communication breakdown, but we'll resolve the Jungle Gym's
communication woes using Message Bus, to show you how it works. 
Here are the inter-department message exchanges we'll accommodate:

 Message | Sender | Listener | Response | Response Listeners |
-------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------ |
 Request permission to proceed with purchase | Procurement | Finance | required | Procurement |
 Request permission to proceed with purchase | Procurement | Legal | required | Procurement |
 Notify and solicit feedback on new purchase | Procurement | Warehouse | optional | Procurement, Sales |
 Notify and solicit feedback on new purchase | Procurement | Sales | optional | Procurement, Warehouse |
 Broadcast equipment news | Procurement | Employees | none | none |

Let's implement Procurement's request to Finance first. 

## Synchronous messaging [](id=synchronous-messaging)

In our example, equipment purchases can't proceed without approval from Finance
and Legal departments. Since special offers from the manufacturers often only
last for a couple hours, Procurement makes it their top priority to get approval
as soon as possible. Implementing their exchange using *synchronous* messaging
makes the most sense. 

![Figure 11.5: Synchronous messaging](../../images/msg-bus-sync-msg.png)

The following table describes how we'll set things up: 

 Destination Key | Type  | Sender | Receivers                                 |
---------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
 `jungle/finance/purchase`          | synchronous | Procurement | Finance |
 `jungle/finance/purchase/response` | synchronous | Finance | Procurement |
 `jungle/legal/purchase`            | synchronous | Procurement | Legal   |
 `jungle/legal/purchase/response`   | synchronous | Legal | Procurement   |

We've set it up so Finance sends its response messages to a destination on which
Procurement will listen. That way a full-bodied response message is sent back to
Procurement in addition to the response object returned from sending the
message. 

*The Procurement Department sends a purchase approval request:* 

<!--Where does this code go? messaging-spring.xml? If so is the code here
simply added to the file? And the code in subsequent descriptions too?-->

<!-- That's a very good question. This would generally be part of a portlet
application. This doesn't look like an actual, working demo, and I think we need
to talk to Jim about it. -Rich --> 

    Message message = new Message();
    message.put("department", "Procurement");
    message.put("partName", part.getName(Locale.US));

    message.setResponseId("1111");
    message.setResponseDestinationName("jungle/finance/purchase/response");

    try {
        String financeResponse = (String) MessageBusUtil.sendSynchronousMessage(
            "jungle/finance/purchase", message, 10000);

        System.out.println(
            "Procurement received Finance sync response to purchase approval for " +
            part.getName(Locale.US) + ": " + financeResponse);

        message.setResponseId("2222");
        message.setResponseDestinationName("jungle/legal/purchase/response");

        String legalResponse = (String) MessageBusUtil.sendSynchronousMessage(
            "jungle/legal/purchase", message, 10000);

        System.out.println(
            "Procurement received Legal sync response to purchase approval for " +
            part.getName(Locale.US) + ": " + legalResponse);

        if (financeResponse.contains("yes") && legalResponse.contains("yes")) {
            sendPurchaseNotification(part, userId);
        }
    }
    catch (MessageBusException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

This sender takes the following steps: 

1. Creates the message using Liferay's `Message` class.

2. Stuffs the message with key/value pairs.

3. Sets a response ID and response destination for listeners to use in replying
   back.

4. Sends the message to the destination with a timeout value of 10,000
   milliseconds.

5. Blocks waiting for the response.

*Finance Department listens for purchase approval requests and replies back:* 

    public class FinanceMessagingImpl implements MessageListener {

        public void receive(Message message) {
            try {
                doReceive(message);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                _log.error("Unable to process message " + message, e);
            }
        }

        protected void doReceive(Message message)
            throws Exception {

            String department = (String) message.get("department");
            String partName = (String) message.get("partName");

            System.out.println("Finance received purchase request for " +
                partName + " from " + department);

            Message responseMessage = MessageBusUtil.createResponseMessage(
                message);

            responseMessage.put("department", "Finance");
            responseMessage.put("partName", partName);
            responseMessage.setPayload("yes");

            MessageBusUtil.sendMessage(
                responseMessage.getDestinationName(), responseMessage);
        }

        private static Log _log =
            LogFactoryUtil.getLog(FinanceMessagingImpl.class);
    }

This listener executes the following steps: 

1. Implements the `receive(Message message)` method of the
   `com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.MessageListener` interface. 

2. Extracts values from the `Message` parameter by getting values associated
   with known keys. 

3. Creates a `Message` based on the message received via the
   `MessageBusUtil.createResponseMessage(message)` method, which accesses the
   response destination name from the `message` variable and sets the
   destination of the response message. 

4. Sets the response message's payload. 

5. Sends the response `Message` to the response destination.

You can implement the listener for the Legal Department similarly. Next we'll
account for Legal Department-related classes in our configuration.

*Message Bus Configuration for the purchase approval request process:*

For Message Bus to direct messages from destinations to listeners, we must
register the listeners by configuring the appropriate mappings in our plugin's
`WEB-INF/src/META-INF/messaging-spring.xml` file (create this file if it's not
already in your plugin). Here is the configuration: 

<!--If the messaging-spring file potentially hasn't been created yet where has
the reader been putting the code snippets from above? Should this statement go
before the first code snippet?--> 

<!-- The above snippets go in the service layer. If you follow the message bus
section in Liferay in Action, you'll see that the Java stuff goes in the service
layer's -Impl class. It's generally a best practice to write the Java classes
and then write the configuration file, because tools like Liferay IDE and
Liferay Developer Studio try to deploy the plugin right away, and if you declare
classes in the configuration file that don't exist yet, the whole plugin blows
up. -Rich -->

                </list>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </beans>

The configuration above specifies the following beans: 

- *Listener beans*: Specify classes to handle messages.
- *Destination beans*: Specify the class *type* and *key* names of the
  destinations.
- *Configurator bean*: Maps listeners to their destinations.

When Finance sends its purchase approval request message for a new three-story
spiral slide, the console reports Finance's receipt of the message,
Procurement's receipt of the callback response from Finance, and Procurement's
receipt of the synchronous response returned from sending the message. Here's
what the console message looks like: 

    Finance received purchase request for three-story spiral slide from Procurement
    Procurement received Finance callback response to purchase approval for three-
    story spiral slide: yes
    Procurement received Finance sync response to purchase approval for three-story 
    spiral slide: yes
    Legal received purchase request for three-story spiral slide from Procurement
    Procurement received Legal callback response to purchase approval for three-
    story spiral slide: yes
    Procurement received Legal sync response to purchase approval for three-story 
    spiral slide: yes

Do you know what all those *yes* messages mean? Success! Jungle Gyms R-Us has
the cash to purchase this cool new slide, and the Legal Department has no gripes
about the slide's safety ratings! 

Next let's have Procurement notify the Sales and Warehouse departments and
solicit their feedback.

## Asynchronous messaging with callbacks [](id=asynchronous-messaging-with-callbacks)

Asynchronous messaging consists of sending a message and then continuing with
processing without blocking waiting for an immediate response. This allows the
sender to continue with other tasks. It's often necessary, however, that the
listener can respond to the sender. This can be done using a call-back.

Jungle Gyms R-Us's Procurement Department must notify the Sales and Warehouse
departments of incoming equipment while simultaneously soliciting their
feedback. To assure all three departments are up to speed, any responses from
the Sales or Warehouse departments are posted to a shared destination. 

The following table describes how we'll set things up: 

| Destination Key            | Type  | Sender | Receivers                     |
---------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
  `jungle/purchase`          | async serial | Procurement |  Sales, Warehouse |
  `jungle/purchase/response` | synchronous  | Sales, Warehouse | Procurement  |

The following image shows asynchronous messaging, with serial dispatching of
messages: 

![Figure 11.6: Asynchronous messaging with *serial* dispatching](../../images/msg-bus-async-serial-msg.png)

Let's package the message as a `JSONObject` and send it to the destination: 

    JSONObject jsonObject = JSONFactoryUtil.createJSONObject();

    jsonObject.put("department", "Procurement");
    jsonObject.put("partName", part.getName(Locale.US));
    jsonObject.put("responseDestinationName", "jungle/purchase/response");

    MessageBusUtil.sendMessage("jungle/purchase", jsonObject.toString());

Here's how the Warehouse Department listens for and handles messages: 

    public void receive(Message message) {

        try {
            doReceive(message);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            _log.error("Unable to process message " + message, e);
        }
    }

    protected void doReceive(Message message)
        throws Exception {

        String payload = (String)message.getPayload();

        JSONObject jsonObject = JSONFactoryUtil.createJSONObject(payload);

        String department = jsonObject.getString("department");
        String partName = jsonObject.getString("partName");
        String responseDestinationName = jsonObject.getString(
                        "responseDestinationName");

        System.out.println("Warehouse received purchase notification for " +
            partName + " from " + department);

        jsonObject = JSONFactoryUtil.createJSONObject();

        jsonObject.put("department", "Warehouse");
        jsonObject.put("partName", partName);
        jsonObject.put("comment", "Ugh! We're running out of space!!");

        MessageBusUtil.sendMessage(
            responseDestinationName, jsonObject.toString());
    }

Here's how this listener deserializes the `JSONObject` from the message: 

1. Gets the message payload and casts it to a `String`. 
2. Creates a `JSONObject` from the payload string. 
3. Gets values from the `JSONObject` using its getter methods.

The class also demonstrates how the Warehouse Department packages a response
message and sends it back to the Procurement Department, using these steps: 

1. Create a `JSONObject`.  
2. Stuff it with name-value pairs. 
3. Send the response message to the original message's response destination.

The Sales department listener can be implemented the same way, substituting
*Sales* as the department value; the comment would likely be different, too. 

You just used the `JSONObject` message type to send an asynchronous response
message using a call-back. 

Remember, we want the Procurement, Sales, and Warehouse departments to be
aware of any message regarding the new playground equipment purchasing process.
Let's leverage our destination keys and department names in handling shared
responses. 

Here's how the Warehouse might handle messages it receives:

    public void receive(Message message) {

        try {
            if (message.getDestinationName().equals(
                    "jungle/purchase"))
            {
                doReceive(message);
            }
            else if (message.getDestinationName().equals(
                    "jungle/purchase/response"))
            {
                doReceiveResponse(message);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            _log.error("Unable to process message " + message, e);
        }
    }

    protected void doReceiveResponse(Message message)
        throws JSONException {

        String payload = (String)message.getPayload();

        JSONObject jsonObject = JSONFactoryUtil.createJSONObject(payload);

        String department = jsonObject.getString("department");

        if (!department.equals("Warehouse")) {
            System.out.println(
                "Warehouse is in the loop on response from " + department);
        }
    }

Let's look at `receive(Message)` for a minute. We've set it up to handle
messages differently depending on their destinations: messages to
`jungle/purchase` are handled as Procurement's purchase notifications, while
messages to `jungle/purchase/response` are treated as departmental responses to
Procurement's purchase notifications.  The `doReceiveResponse(Message)` method
performs an important task, checking that the response comes from a department
other than itself, and printing an error if it doesn't. 

Here are the configuration elements we added to the `messaging-spring.xml` from
the previous section:

*Listener beans*: 

        <bean id="messageListener.warehouse_listener" class="com.liferay.training.parts.messaging.impl.WarehouseMessagingImpl" />
        <bean id="messageListener.sales_listener" class="com.liferay.training.parts.messaging.impl.SalesMessagingImpl" />

*Destination beans*: The purchase notifications will be sent to a *serial*
  destination and the responses will be sent to a *synchronous* destination. 

        <bean id="destination.purchase" class="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.SerialDestination">
            <property name="name" value="jungle/purchase" />
        </bean>

        <bean id="destination.purchase.response" class="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.SynchronousDestination">
            <property name="name" value="jungle/purchase/response" />
        </bean>

*Configuration bean listener map entry*: Warehouse and Sales are registered
  to listen for the notifications from Procurement. All three departments are
registered to listen for inter-departmental responses.

        <entry key="jungle/purchase">
            <list value-type="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.MessageListener">
                <ref bean="messageListener.warehouse_listener" />
                <ref bean="messageListener.sales_listener" />
            </list>
        </entry>
        <entry key="jungle/purchase/response">
            <list value-type="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.MessageListener">
                <ref bean="messageListener.procurement_listener" />
                <ref bean="messageListener.warehouse_listener" />
                <ref bean="messageListener.sales_listener" />
            </list>
        </entry>

*Configuration bean destination list references*:

        <ref bean="destination.purchase"/>
        <ref bean="destination.purchase.response"/>

Don't forget to send news of these new products to *all* Jungle Gyms R-Us
employees.

<!-- Missing transition. --> 

## Asynchronous "Send and Forget" [](id=asynchronous-send-and-forget)

In the *send and forget* model, the sender sends messages and continues
processing. We'll apply this behavior to Jungle Gym's company-wide new product
notification.

Procurement isn't expecting response messages from individual employees, so
there's no need for the company-wide listener to package up responses. We do,
however, want everyone to get product news at the *same time*, so instead of
dispatching news to employees *serially* we'll dispatch *in parallel*.

![Figure 11.7: Asynchronous messaging with *parallel* dispatching](../../images/msg-bus-async-parallel-msg.png)

We'll specify a parallel destination type in our `messaging-spring.xml`:

*Destination bean*:

        <bean id="destination.employee.news" class="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.ParallelDestination">
                <property name="name" value="jungle/employee/news" />
        </bean>

*Listener bean*:

        <bean id="messageListener.employee_listener" class="com.liferay.training.parts.messaging.impl.EmployeeMessagingImpl" />

*Configuration bean listener map entry*: 

        <entry key="jungle/employee/news">
            <list value-type="com.liferay.portal.kernel.messaging.MessageListener">
                <ref bean="messageListener.employee_listener" />
            </list>
        </entry>

*Configuration bean destination list reference*: 

        <ref bean="destination.employee.news"/>

Congratulations! You implemented inter-departmental communications for the
procurement process at Jungle Gyms R-Us.

Along the way you used Message Bus to implement the following:

- Sender, listener, and destination components. 
- Synchronous and Asynchronous messaging schemes. 
- *Serial* and *parallel* message dispatching. 
- Java and JSON message types.

Next we'll show you the Device Detection API and its capabilities.
