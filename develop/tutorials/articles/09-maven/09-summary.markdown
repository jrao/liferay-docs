# Summary [](id=summary-6)

"But the chair whose violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
Lenore II shall press, ah, nevermore!"

Lenore II didn't make it through the chapter, but you did. You can develop all
your Liferay plugins using Maven; there's a standard process for generating the
archetypes and selecting your plugin options for each plugin type. You can then
customize the archetype to your liking. Using Maven to develop plugins offers an
easy and effective way to customize your Liferay Portal. 

You accomplished a lot in this chapter. You configured Maven locally, downloaded
and installed the required Liferay Maven artifacts, and learned to create
Liferay plugins with Maven. You're ready to create all kinds of Liferay plugins
based on Liferay's plugin archetypes. 

We've explored Maven in this chapter, and the Plugins SDK in earlier chapters.
You've seen two powerful tools you can use to develop your Liferay plugins. In
addition to these, there's Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio! Let's look
at Liferay IDE in the next chapter.

**Note:** Are you wondering if we're going to make more terrible jokes that
steal from classic poetry? Quoth the Maven, "Probably."

her off? -->

Hopefully not too explicit. -->
