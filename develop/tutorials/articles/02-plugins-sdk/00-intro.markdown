# The Plugins SDK [](id=the-plugins-sdk)

Java developers use a wide variety of tools and development environments.
Liferay makes every effort to remain tool agnostic, so you can choose the tools
that work best for you. To that end, we provide a Plugins Software Development
Kit (SDK) based on Apache Ant that can be used along with any editor or
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Much of this guide uses the Plugins
SDK and a text editor, but use whatever tool you're most comfortable with. As an
alternative to the Plugins SDK, in Chapter 10 we discuss Liferay IDE, a plugin
for Eclipse that simplifies development for Liferay.

**Tip**: If you use Eclipse and intend to use it from the very beginning, you
might want to check out Chapter 10 first before reading this chapter.

We discuss the following topics in this chapter: 

- **Initial Setup:** Install the Plugins SDK and configure it to use with your
  Liferay Portal server. 
- **Structure of the SDK:** Where to develop your plugin within the SDK and what
  Apache Ant targets are available. 
- **Best Practices:** Helpful ways for organizing your plugin projects. 

Setting up the Plugins SDK is easy. Let's get to it.
