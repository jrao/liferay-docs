Portal by creating custom themes. During this process, you created your own
theme, learned about its directory structure, and discovered the value of style
inheritance from a parent theme. You also learned about Liferay's JavaScript
library, AlloyUI, and how to make your theme configurable by adding settings
that portal administrators can manage within Liferay. Your CSS options,
