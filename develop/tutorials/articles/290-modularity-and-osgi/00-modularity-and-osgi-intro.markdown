# Modularity and OSGi [](id=modularity-and-osgi)

Things we use every day are often comprise subsystems that are carefully
designed, created, and tested. For example, a car has an engine, suspension, and
air conditioner. Teams of engineers, machinists, and technicians, make these
subsystems  the best they can be separately, before combining them to create a
high quality car. This is modularity in action--creating things from smaller
well designed, well tested things. 

DXP is modular too. It comprises code modules created and tested independently
and in parallel. It's a platform on which modules and modular applications are
installed, started, used, stopped, and uninstalled. DXP's components were built
using OSGi's modularity standards and the Apache Felix and Eclipse Equinox
projects it integrates with implement these standards too. 

These tutorials demonstrate developing OSGI services and components to customize
DXP and create applications on it. As Liferay's developers used modules to
create DXP and its applications, you and your teammates can enjoy developing
your own modules, applications, and customizations in parallel on DXP.
