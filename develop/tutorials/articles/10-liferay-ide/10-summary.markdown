In this chapter we explored Liferay IDE, an extension of Eclipse IDE. You
learned to to install and set up Liferay IDE, then to create and deploy Liferay
projects, as well as import existing projects into Liferay IDE. Admit it--it's a
slick set of tools! We hope you take advantage of it in using Liferay Portal and
developing your Liferay plugins. 

After learning all about Liferay IDE we looked at managing workflows using Kaleo
Designer for Java in Liferay Developer Studio. With Developer Studio's dynamic
workflow diagram, you can visualize your workflow and create steps to ensure a
successful business process. The script and template editors give you a
convenient workspace to further enhance your workflow development environment.

Because Developer Studio has access to your custom business logic APIs and
Liferay Portal APIs, it's simple to customize your workflow definition. To get
your workflows running in Liferay, you can publish directly to your existing
Liferay server; the configuration process is quick and easy. With all of its
features, the Kaleo Designer for Java in Developer Studio is a powerful yet
simple tool. 

Next, let's get up-close and personal with Liferay's APIs!
