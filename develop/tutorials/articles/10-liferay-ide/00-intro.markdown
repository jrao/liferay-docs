# Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio [](id=liferay-ide-and-liferay-developer-studio)

If you've been writing software for a while, you probably have a set of tools
that you regularly use. This set of tools has been carefully collected over the
years, and every tool is there for one reason: to contribute to your
productivity. 

Many of us at Liferay are like that, which is why our SDKs are designed to work
with any text editor or IDE. You can be productive on the Liferay platform using
any tool you want. To jumpstart your efforts, however, we also provide an IDE
environment fully integrated with Eclipse. We've designed this carefully, so
that it integrates well with our existing SDKs, Maven, and other tools that are
out there. Liferay IDE helps you manage many features of Liferay's platform,
making them easier to use. There are editors for Service Builder files, workflow
definitions, layout templates, and more. You'll find wizards for creating every
kind of Liferay project there is, snippets for tag libraries, and auto-deploy of
changes to plugins. 

Whether you've been using Liferay for a long time or are just getting started,
it's worth your time to check out Liferay IDE and see whether it's another of
those tools you can add to your toolbox. We think you'll be glad you did. 

In this chapter we'll cover the following topics:
